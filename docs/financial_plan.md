## 4. Pricing Strategy

Our pricing for each event is determined by the scope of services and the scale of the event. For transparency, we generally present clients with a detailed breakdown of costs, showing the supplier charges and our fee. On average, we aim to apply a **markup of about 30–35%** on the total supplier cost to cover our planning services and profit. We also offer a range of add-on services, including Invitation Services, Guest Gifts, and Event Printing, which can be quoted separately.
