# Payment & Booking Timeline Flow

**Note:** This entire payment and booking process is designed to be managed and automated within the **Financial Hub (Module 5)** of our proprietary **EventOS** software.

This document outlines the critical path for client payments and booking confirmations to ensure a tight, financially secure workflow for every event.

---

### **Phase 1: Inquiry & Proposal (Approx. 1-2 weeks)**

*   **Action:** Client makes an inquiry & discovery call is completed.
*   **Action:** A detailed proposal and contract are sent to the client.
*   **Goal:** Client agrees to the proposal and is ready to sign.

⬇️

### **Phase 2: Booking Confirmation & Deposit**

*   **Action:** Client signs the contract electronically.
*   **MILESTONE 1 (PAYMENT): Client pays a 30% non-refundable deposit.**
*   **Confirmation:** The event date is officially secured in our calendar. **No further work is done until the deposit is cleared.**

⬇️

### **Phase 3: Planning & Mid-Point Payment (6 Weeks Before Event)**

*   **Action:** Planning continues, and suppliers are finalized.
*   **MILESTONE 2 (PAYMENT): Client pays a 40% installment.**
*   **Action (Supplier Payment):** Upon receipt of the client's 40% payment, we pay the required deposits to all suppliers (e.g., venue, caterer). This ensures we are never paying suppliers out of our own funds.

⬇️

### **Phase 4: Final Payment (3 Weeks Before Event)**

*   **Action:** All final details are confirmed with the client and suppliers.
*   **MILESTONE 3 (PAYMENT): Client pays the final 30% balance.**
*   **Confirmation:** The client is now fully paid up. The event is fully locked in and confirmed.

⬇️

### **Phase 5: Event Execution (Event Day)**

*   **Action:** The event takes place, and all services are delivered by suppliers.
*   **Action:** We perform quality checks throughout the day to ensure everything meets the contract standards.

⬇️

### **Phase 6: Post-Event Settlement (2-7 Days After Event)**

*   **Action:** After confirming all services were delivered to standard, **we pay the final balances to all suppliers.**
*   **Confirmation:** All financial obligations are complete, and the final profit for the event is calculated.
