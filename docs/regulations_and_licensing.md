# UK Regulations, Laws, and Licensing for Event Planners

This document outlines the key legal and compliance areas for an event planning business operating in the UK.

## 1. Business Structure & Registration

*   **Business Structure:** Operating as a **Private Limited Company (Ltd)** is recommended to protect personal assets by limiting liability.
*   **Registration:** The company must be registered with **Companies House**, and annual accounts and confirmation statements must be filed on time.
*   **VAT:** You must register for VAT with HMRC once your annual turnover exceeds the threshold (currently £85,000).

## 2. Insurance

Comprehensive insurance is essential to protect your business, clients, and suppliers.

*   **Public Liability Insurance:** Covers injury to third parties or damage to their property. A minimum of £5 million is recommended and often required by venues.
*   **Employer's Liability Insurance:** A legal requirement if you have any employees (including temporary staff). It covers claims from employees for work-related injury or illness.
*   **Professional Indemnity Insurance:** Protects you against claims of negligence or mistakes in the services you provide, such as errors in planning that cause financial loss to the client.

## 3. Health & Safety

You have a legal duty of care to your clients, guests, and staff.

*   **Risk Assessments:** You must conduct a thorough risk assessment for each event to identify potential hazards and implement control measures.
*   **Event Safety:** For larger events, you may need to work with a dedicated Event Safety Officer and liaise with local authorities to obtain a safety certificate.

## 4. Licensing

Depending on the nature of the event, various licenses may be required.

*   **Alcohol License:** If alcohol is sold or served, the venue must have a Premises Licence, or you may need to apply for a Temporary Event Notice (TEN) from the local council.
*   **Entertainment License:** Live music, DJs, and other forms of public entertainment may require a license under the Licensing Act 2003, unless the venue is already covered.
*   **Fireworks & Pyrotechnics:** Fireworks displays require a licensed operator and must comply with local authority regulations regarding noise and safety.
*   **Food Hygiene:** While you are outsourcing catering, you must ensure your chosen caterers have the appropriate food hygiene certifications and a good food hygiene rating.

## 5. Contracts & Legal Agreements

*   **Client Contracts:** A clear, legally reviewed contract should be in place with every client, outlining the scope of services, payment schedule, cancellation policy, and limitations of liability.
*   **Supplier Contracts:** You should also have contracts with your suppliers that detail their responsibilities, payment terms, and insurance requirements. A template for this is available in 'supplier_contract_template.md'.

## 6. Data Protection

*   **GDPR:** You must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) when handling any personal data of clients, guests, or staff.
*   **Action - Register with ICO:** You must register your business with the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office).
*   **Action - Privacy Policy:** You must have a clear Privacy Policy on your website.
*   **Action - Data Management:** You must implement a secure system for storing and deleting client data after a set period (e.g., 7 years).
