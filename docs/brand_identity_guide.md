# Complete Peace of Mind Events - Brand Identity Guide

---

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

Our brand voice is a core part of how we communicate. It should be consistent across all platforms, from the website and brochures to social media captions and client emails.

*   **Core Identity:** Effortless, Trusted, Elegant.
*   **Tone:** Sophisticated but approachable. Confident, calm, and reassuring.
*   **Language:** We use evocative and professional language. 
    *   **Use words like:** Curate, bespoke, seamless, unforgettable, elevated, detailed, exclusive.
    *   **Avoid:** Industry jargon, overly casual slang, or language that implies stress or disorganization.

**Example:**
*   **Instead of:** "We'll sort out all the stuff for your wedding."
*   **Use:** "We will curate a bespoke team of suppliers to seamlessly execute every detail of your wedding day."

## 3. Typography

Our typography pairs a classic, elegant serif for headings with a clean, readable sans-serif for body text.

### Primary Typeface (Headings)

*   **Font:** **Playfair Display**
*   **Use:** For all main headings and titles. It's elegant, high-contrast, and has a touch of classic charm.
*   **Style:** Use in Title Case. Can be used in a larger font size for impact.
*   **Source:** Available on Google Fonts.

### Secondary Typeface (Body Text)

*   **Font:** **Montserrat**
*   **Use:** For all paragraphs, descriptions, and general body copy.
*   **Style:** Use in sentence case. It's clean, modern, and highly readable across all devices.
*   **Source:** Available on Google Fonts.

**Example:**

# This is a Playfair Display Heading

This is a paragraph of body text set in Montserrat. It is clean, easy to read, and complements the elegance of the heading typeface.

## 4. Logo Usage

While the final logo will be designed by a professional graphic designer, these guidelines should be followed for its use.

### Core Principles

*   **Clarity:** The logo should always be clear and legible.
*   **Consistency:** Use the primary logo wherever possible. Use the correct colors and do not alter the logo's proportions.

### Logo Variations

You should have three main logo variations:

1.  **Primary Logo:** The full company name with any accompanying icon. This is the default version.
2.  **Secondary Logo / Monogram:** A simplified version, perhaps using the initials "CPoM", for use in smaller spaces like social media profile pictures or as a favicon.
3.  **Wordmark:** The company name in the chosen brand font, for use where the full logo is not necessary.

### Spacing & Placement

*   **Clear Space:** Always leave a margin of clear space around the logo, at least the height of the main capital letter in the logo. This prevents it from feeling cluttered.
*   **Placement:** The logo should typically be placed in the top-left or top-center of documents and web pages.

### Incorrect Usage

*   **Do Not Stretch or Distort** the logo's proportions.
*   **Do Not Change the Logo's Colors** outside of the defined primary and secondary palettes.
*   **Do Not Place the Logo on a Visually Busy Background** that makes it hard to read.
*   **Do Not Rotate** the logo.
