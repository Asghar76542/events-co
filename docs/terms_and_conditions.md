## 2. Outsourced Services & Liability

As an event planning company, we specialize in the coordination and management of events. We do not directly provide services such as catering, venue hire, floral arrangements, photography, or entertainment. These services are outsourced to trusted third-party suppliers.

While Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd. will exercise reasonable skill and care in the selection of suppliers, we act as an agent in the booking of their services. The contract for the delivery of these services is between the client and the supplier.

**Limitation of Liability:** Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd. shall not be held liable for any failure of performance, breach of contract, or any other loss or damage caused by a third-party supplier. This includes, but is not limited to, a supplier's failure to arrive, substandard service, or damage to property. Our liability is strictly limited to the coordination and management services we provide.

## 3. Deposits & Payments

*   A non-refundable deposit of 30% of the total event cost is required to secure our services and the event date.
*   A further payment of 40% is due 6 weeks before the event.
*   The final balance of 30% is due 3 weeks before the event.
*   No services, including supplier bookings, will be confirmed until the required payments have been received.

## 4. Cancellation

*   **Cancellation by Client:** All deposits are non-refundable. Cancellations made within 6 weeks of the event date will require payment of the full event cost.
*   **Cancellation by Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd.:** In the unlikely event that we are unable to provide our services, we will refund any payments made directly to us. Our liability will be limited to the amount paid for our coordination services.

## 5. Supplier Substitution

Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd. reserves the right to substitute a supplier should the original supplier become unavailable or fail to meet the standards of the contract. We will use our professional judgment to select a suitable replacement and will inform the client of any necessary changes.

## 6. Force Majeure

We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations where such failure is as a result of acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, nationalisation, government sanction, blockage, embargo, labor dispute, strike, lockout or interruption or failure of electricity or telephone service.
