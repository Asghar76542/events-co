    *   Examples: Small décor adjustments, menu substitutions, minor timing delays.
    *   Action: The relevant coordinator handles the issue and informs the Lead Planner.

*   **Level 2 Issues (Medium - escalate):
    *   Examples: Supplier no-show, equipment failure, significant weather changes.
    *   Action: The Lead Planner is immediately notified and activates the backup plan.

*   **Level 3 Issues (Major - emergency):
    *   Examples: Medical emergency, fire/evacuation, major structural issue.
    *   Action: The Lead Planner immediately calls emergency services and implements the venue's safety and evacuation plan.

*   **Reputational Risks:**
    *   For issues that could impact reputation (e.g., significant client dissatisfaction, a viral negative social media post), refer to the pre-prepared PR crisis plan. The Lead Planner is responsible for initiating this plan.
