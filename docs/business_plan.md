# Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd. - Business Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

Complete Peace of Mind Events Ltd. will offer fully managed wedding and luxury event solutions across the UK, covering every aspect from décor, catering, entertainment, and fireworks, to luxury car hire and photography.

The company will operate on an asset-light model initially — outsourcing key services such as catering, transport, A/V, and fireworks while building partnerships with trusted suppliers nationwide. Over time, it will reinvest profits into owning décor, equipment, and vehicles to increase profit margins.

**Mission:** To deliver flawless, unforgettable weddings and events by managing every detail — allowing clients to relax and enjoy their special day with complete peace of mind.

**Vision:** To become one of the UK's most trusted, elegant, and professional wedding and event organisers, offering both indoor and outdoor experiences with a luxury edge.

## 2. Business Objectives

*   **Year 1: Launch and Establish Foundations.** Introduce the brand to the market and build awareness through strategic marketing. Secure 5 initial bookings and execute each event to the highest standard, garnering positive client feedback. Develop a network of at least 15 reliable suppliers and venue partners across the UK. Achieve a strong start financially, with an aim for £35,000–£40,000 in net profit after covering all expenses.
*   **Year 2: Scale Services and Invest in Assets.** Expand the number of annual events to around 10–12, diversifying our portfolio (e.g. adding corporate events or larger weddings). Reinvest a portion of Year 1 profits into acquiring our own décor inventory and AV equipment, reducing reliance on external rentals.
*   **Year 3: Consolidate Growth and Enhance Offerings.** Aim to execute 20+ events per year, firmly establishing the company’s presence in the Midlands and beyond. Invest in premium assets such as luxury vehicles (chauffeur cars) to offer in-house transport services.

## 4. Operational Plan

Our operational plan is a comprehensive, step-by-step system that takes us from finding clients to event day execution. This is our complete business playbook, broken down into 6 phases:

*   **Phase 1: Finding Clients (Lead Generation & Acquisition):** We will establish our digital presence through a professional website and active social media channels (Instagram, TikTok). This will be supplemented by targeted paid advertising on Google and Facebook, and strategic partnerships with venues and vendors to generate leads.

*   **Phase 2: Booking Process (Sales & Conversion):** New leads will be contacted within 4 hours to schedule a discovery call. During this call, we will qualify the lead, understand their vision, and gather requirements. A detailed proposal and contract will be sent within 48 hours, with the deal being closed upon electronic signature and receipt of a 30% deposit.

*   **Phase 3: Supplier Management & Booking:** Once a client is booked, we will create a detailed supplier brief and request quotes from our network of vetted suppliers. We will use a comparison matrix to select the best suppliers, and then secure their services with a formal contract.

*   **Phase 4: Financial Operations & Payment Flow:** We will follow a strict payment schedule to protect our cash flow. The client pays in three installments (30% deposit, 40% at 6 weeks out, 30% at 3 weeks out). Supplier deposits are only paid after we receive the client's second payment.

*   **Phase 5: Event Planning & Execution:** A detailed 12-week planning timeline ensures all tasks are completed on schedule. On the event day, we will use a detailed run sheet and a clear command structure to manage all suppliers and ensure a flawless execution.

*   **Phase 6: Post-Event & Growth:** After the event, we will conduct an internal debrief, pay supplier final balances, and send a thank you note to the client. We will then request feedback and testimonials to use in our marketing materials and encourage future referrals through an incentive program.

## 8. Integrated Technology Stack: EventOS

To achieve unparalleled efficiency and scalability, we will develop a proprietary, cloud-based business operating system called **EventOS**. This system will be the central nervous system for the entire operation, integrating all aspects of the business into a single, seamless platform.

EventOS will be a modular application featuring:
*   **A CRM Hub** for lead and client management.
*   **An Event Management Hub** for project planning, timelines, and task management.
*   **A Supplier & Vendor Management Hub** with a directory and performance ratings.
*   **A Financial Hub** for invoicing, expense tracking, and profitability analysis.
*   **A Resource Hub** incorporating the Digital Supplier Gallery.
*   **A Quality & Feedback Hub** for continuous improvement.

This integrated system will provide a significant competitive advantage, allowing us to deliver a true "peace of mind" experience for our clients and run the business with data-driven precision. The full design specification is detailed in the `eventos_design_spec.md` document.

## 9. Human Resources & Team Structure

*   **Role Definitions:** Create detailed job descriptions for all roles, including Lead Planner, Event Coordinator, and freelancers.
*   **Recruitment:** Develop a strategy for finding and vetting a pool of reliable freelancers before they are needed.
*   **Onboarding:** Create a standardized onboarding checklist for all new team members.

## 10. Comprehensive Risk Management

*   **Financial Risks:** Mitigate risks from client cancellations with a strict contract, a 3-6 month cash reserve, and service diversification.
*   **Reputational Risks:** Manage risks from bad reviews with proactive review management and a PR crisis plan.
*   **Operational Risks:** Mitigate risks from supplier failure by having a vetted list of primary, secondary, and tertiary suppliers for each key category.

## 11. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Measurements

*   **Sales & Marketing:** Track Lead-to-Booking Conversion Rate (Target: 25-30%), Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), and Average Booking Value (ABV).
*   **Operational:** Track Client Satisfaction Score (Target: 9/10+), Supplier On-Time Performance, and Profit Margin Per Event (Target: 35-40%).
*   **Financial:** Track Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Cash Flow, and Gross & Net Profit Margins.

*   **Hiring Trigger:** We will hire a full-time Coordinator when the Lead Planner spends over 50% of their time on execution or when we have 4+ events in a single month.
*   **Expansion Trigger:** We will expand geographically when 20% of qualified leads come from a new region and we have successfully delivered 3+ events there.
