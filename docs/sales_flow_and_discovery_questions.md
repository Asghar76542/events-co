## Part 1: The Sales Flowchart

**Note:** This entire sales process is designed to be managed within the **Lead Management (Module 2)** of our proprietary **EventOS** software, from automated lead capture to final booking.


**Step 1: Initial Contact (Respond within 4 hours)**
*   **Action:** Receive lead from website, social media, or referral.
*   **Action:** Send initial response using the outreach script below.
*   **Goal:** Acknowledge the inquiry, create a personal connection, and schedule a 15-30 minute discovery call.

⬇️

**Step 2: The Discovery Call (15-30 minutes)**
*   **Action:** Follow the detailed discovery call agenda in Part 2.
*   **Goal:** Qualify the lead, build rapport, understand their vision and budget, and gather all information needed for a proposal.

⬇️

**Step 3: Visual Selection (Post-Discovery Call)**
*   **Action:** Grant the client password-protected access to the private Digital Supplier Gallery.
*   **Goal:** Allow the client to browse and select their preferred styles for tableware, décor, florals, etc. This makes the process interactive and ensures the proposal is highly personalized.

⬇️

**Step 4: Proposal & Follow-Up (Send within 48 hours)**
*   **Action:** Create and send a detailed, personalized proposal and contract, incorporating the client's selections from the gallery.
*   **Action:** If no response after 3 days, send a polite follow-up email.
*   **Goal:** Get the client to review and accept the proposal.

⬇️

**Step 5: Closing the Deal**
*   **Action:** Client signs the contract electronically (e.g., via DocuSign).
*   **Action:** Client pays the 30% non-refundable deposit via the provided payment link.
*   **Goal:** Deal Closed. The client is officially onboarded.
