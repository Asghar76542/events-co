# EventOS: The Complete Business Operating System for "Complete Peace of Mind Events"

Here is the full design for a custom back-office software application to run your entire business. I've called it **EventOS** (Event Operating System) because it's designed to be the central nervous system for your operations.

## 🏗️ CORE ARCHITECTURE & USER ROLES

**EventOS** will be a cloud-based, modular application accessible via web browser and mobile app.

**User Roles & Permissions:**
*   **Admin (Founder):** God-mode access to everything.
*   **Planner (Full-time Staff):** Access to all leads, their assigned events, supplier info, and relevant reports. Cannot see global company financials.

*   **Client (Portal Access):** Secure, read-only access to their own event dashboard. They can see their timeline, approve selections, view invoices, and access the Resource Hub. They cannot see internal notes or supplier costs.
